# Family unity's look
This project was made in winter 2015 at the [Fachhochschule Potsdam](http://www.fh-potsdam.de) as part of the course ["(Steel Ant) Input / Output"](https://fhp.incom.org/workspace/6176) supervised by [Fabian Mor√≥n Zifras](https://fhp.incom.org/profil/270). The idea is to create an algorithm that generates visual graphics.
